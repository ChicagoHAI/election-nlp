INFRASTRUCTURE
DONALD J. TRUMP’S VISION
- Transform America’s crumbling infrastructure into a golden opportunity for accelerated economic growth and more rapid productivity gains with a deficit-neutral plan targeting substantial new infrastructure investments.
- Pursue an “America’s Infrastructure First” policy that supports investments in transportation, clean water, a modern and reliable electricity grid, telecommunications, security infrastructure, and other pressing domestic infrastructure needs.
- Refocus government spending on American infrastructure and away from the Obama-Clinton globalization agenda.
- Provide maximum flexibility to the states.
- Create thousands of new jobs in construction, steel manufacturing, and other sectors to build the transportation, water, telecommunications and energy infrastructure needed to enable new economic development in the U.S., all of which will generate new tax revenues.
- Put American steel made by American workers into the backbone of America’s infrastructure.
- Leverage new revenues and work with financing authorities, public-private partnerships, and other prudent funding opportunities.
- Harness market forces to help attract new private infrastructure investments through a deficit-neutral system of infrastructure tax credits.
- Implement a bold, visionary plan for a cost-effective system of roads, bridges, tunnels, airports, railroads, ports and waterways, and pipelines in the proud tradition of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who championed the interstate highway system.
- Link increases in spending to reforms that streamline permitting and approvals, improve the project delivery system, and cut wasteful spending on boondoggles.
- Employ incentive-based contracting to ensure projects are on time and on budget.
- Approve private sector energy infrastructure projects—including pipelines and coal export facilities—to better connect American coal and shale energy production with markets and consumers.
- Work with Congress to modernize our airports and air traffic control systems, end long wait times, and reform the FAA and TSA, while also ensuring that American travelers are safe from terrorism and other threats.
- Incorporate new technologies and innovations into our national transportation system such as state-of-the-art pipelines, advancements in maritime commerce, and the next generation of vehicles.
- Make clean water a high priority. Develop a long-term water infrastructure plan with city, state and federal leaders to upgrade aging water systems. Triple funding for state revolving loan fund programs to help states and local governments upgrade critical drinking water and wastewater infrastructure.
- Link increased investments with positive reforms to infrastructure programs that reduce waste and cut costs. Complete projects faster and at lower cost through significant regulatory reform and ending needless red-tape.  
KEY ISSUES
- Infrastructure investment strengthens our economic platform, makes America more competitive, creates millions of jobs, increases wages for American workers, and reduces the costs of goods and services for American consumers.
- America’s infrastructure is a linchpin of private sector growth but, today, much of our infrastructure is crumbling.
- More than 60,000 bridges are considered “structurally deficient.” Traffic delays cost the U.S. economy more than $50 billion annually. Most major roads are rated as “less than good condition.”
-  An investigation this year by USA Today “identified almost 2,000 additional water systems spanning all 50 states where testing has shown excessive levels of lead contamination over the past four years.” This included 350 systems that supplied drinking water to schools or day care facilities.
- According to the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), without major improvements to our transportation systems, “the United States will lose more than 2.5 million jobs by 2025” (NAM, Build To Win, 2016). NAM estimates a “ten-year funding gap” of approximately $1 trillion. The Trump Infrastructure Plan is aimed at achieving a target of investment to fill this gap. NAM also found that $8 billion in infrastructure tax credits would support $226 billion in infrastructure investment over 10 years. Innovative financing programs also provide a 10-to-1 return on investment.
- Under the failing Obama-Clinton policies, infrastructure projects across the U.S. are routinely delayed for years and years due to endless studies, layer-upon-layer of red-tape, bureaucracy, and lawsuits—with virtually no end in sight. This increases costs on taxpayers and blocks Americans from obtaining the kind of infrastructure that is needed for them to compete economically.
- According to the Wall Street Journal, “more than a dozen [energy infrastructure] projects, worth about $33 billion, have been either rejected by regulators or withdrawn by developers since 2012, with billions more tied up in projects still in regulatory limbo.” This includes coal and shale energy export facilities. Major pipelines are being blocked as well. As noted in the Wall Street Journal, blocking such projects “leaves some communities without access to lower-cost fuel and higher-paying jobs.”
CONTRAST WITH HILLARY CLINTON
- Hillary Clinton supported NAFTA, supported China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, and allowed China to run up $1 trillion in cumulative trade deficits with the United States as Secretary of State. When she sent American jobs overseas, she also sent our tax base that supports our infrastructure. She rebuilt foreign countries, while America’s infrastructure crumbled.
- With Hillary Clinton’s full support, the Obama Administration spent more than $840 billion in taxpayer dollars on the “stimulus” program, which they dishonestly sold to the American people on the basis that the money would go to “shovel-ready” infrastructure projects. Yet, only 1% of the stimulus was invested in our nation’s drinking water systems. Less than 5% overall actually went toward America’s infrastructure. Billions were wasted on giveaways to their political friends and cronies.
- Hillary Clinton proposes a massive $275 billion tax increase on American businesses to help fund an “infrastructure bank” that is controlled by politicians and bureaucrats in Washington DC.
- Her tax hikes will drive more businesses and jobs out of America, further hollowing out our industrial and manufacturing base.
- Since Hillary Clinton will do nothing meaningful to fix the broken permitting and regulatory bureaucracy, very little real progress or improvements to our nation’s infrastructure will ever take place. Hillary Clinton will also continue to block major infrastructure projects like the Keystone XL pipeline.
- Hillary Clinton supports "open trade and open borders" which places America's transportation systems, financial systems, and economic systems at grave risk.

CYBERSECURITY
DONALD J. TRUMP’S VISION
- Order an immediate review of all U.S. cyber defenses and vulnerabilities, including critical infrastructure, by a Cyber Review Team of individuals from the military, law enforcement, and the private sector.
- The Cyber Review Team will provide specific recommendations for safeguarding different entities with the best defense technologies tailored to the likely threats, and will followed up regularly at various Federal agencies and departments.
- The Cyber Review Team will establish detailed protocols and mandatory cyber awareness training for all government employees while remaining current on evolving methods of cyber-attack.
- Instruct the U.S. Department of Justice to create Joint Task Forces throughout the U.S. to coordinate Federal, State, and local law enforcement responses to cyber threats.
- Order the Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to provide recommendations for enhancing U.S. Cyber Command, with a focus on both offense and defense in the cyber domain.
- Develop the offensive cyber capabilities we need to deter attacks by both state and non-state actors and, if necessary, to respond appropriately.

VETERAN AFFAIRS REFORM
DONALD J. TRUMP’S VISION
- Ensure our veterans get the care they need wherever and whenever they need it. No more long drives. No more waiting backlogs. No more excessive red tape. Just the care and support they earned with their service to our country.
- Support the whole veteran, not just their physical health care, but also by addressing their invisible wounds, investing in our service members' post-active duty success, transforming the VA to meet the needs of 21st century service members, and better meeting the needs of our female veterans.
- Make the VA great again by firing the corrupt and incompetent VA executives who let our veterans down, by modernizing the VA, and by empowering the doctors and nurses to ensure our veterans receive the best care available in a timely manner.
Donald J. Trump's 10 Point Plan to Reform The Department of Veterans Affairs
1. Appoint a VA Secretary whose sole purpose will be to serve veterans. Under a Trump Administration, the needs of D.C. bureaucrats will no longer be placed above those of our veterans.
2. Use the powers of the presidency to remove and discipline the federal employees and managers who have violated the public's trust and failed to carry out the duties on behalf of our veterans.
3. Ask that Congress pass legislation that empowers the Secretary of the VA to discipline or terminate any employee who has jeopardized the health, safety or well-being of a veteran.
4. Create a commission to investigate all the fraud, cover-ups, and wrong-doing that has taken place in the VA, and present these findings to Congress to spur legislative reform.
5. Protect and promote honest employees at the VA who highlight wrongdoing, and guarantee their jobs will be protected.
6. Create a private White House hotline, which will be active 24 hours a day answered by a real person. It will be devoted to answering veteran's complaints of wrongdoing at the VA and ensure no complaints fall through the cracks.
7. Stop giving bonuses to any VA employees who are wasting money, and start rewarding employees who seek to improve the VA's service, cut waste, and save lives.
8. Reform the visa system to ensure veterans are at the front of the line for health services, not the back.
9. Increase the number of mental health care professionals, and allow veteran's to be able to seek mental health care outside of the VA.
10. Ensure every veteran has the choice to seek care at the VA or at a private service provider of their own choice. Under a Trump Administration, no veteran will die waiting for service.

TRADE
DONALD J. TRUMP’S VISION
- Negotiate fair trade deals that create American jobs, increase American wages, and reduce America's trade deficit.
Donald J. Trump's 7 Point Plan To Rebuild the American Economy by Fighting for Free Trade
1. Withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which has not yet been ratified.
2. Appoint tough and smart trade negotiators to fight on behalf of American workers.
3. Direct the Secretary of Commerce to identify every violation of trade agreements a foreign country is currently using to harm our workers, and also direct all appropriate agencies to use every tool under American and international law to end these abuses.
4. Tell NAFTA partners that we intend to immediately renegotiate the terms of that agreement to get a better deal for our workers. If they don’t agree to a renegotiation, we will submit notice that the U.S. intends to withdraw from the deal. Eliminate Mexico’s one-side backdoor tariff through the VAT and end sweatshops in Mexico that undercut U.S. workers.
5. Instruct the Treasury Secretary to label China a currency manipulator.
6. Instruct the U.S. Trade Representative to bring trade cases against China, both in this country and at the WTO. China's unfair subsidy behavior is prohibited by the terms of its entrance to the WTO.
7. Use every lawful presidential power to remedy trade disputes if China does not stop its illegal activities, including its theft of American trade secrets - including the application of tariffs consistent with Section 201 and 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 and Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.
KEY ISSUES
- America has lost nearly one-third of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA and 50,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization. [Economic Policy Institute, April 23, 2015]
- President Obama predicted that the trade deal with South Korea would increase our exports to South Korea by more than $10 billion – resulting in some 70,000 jobs. It has killed nearly 100,000. Our exports to South Korea haven’t increased at all, but their imports to us have surged more than $15 billion – more than doubling our trade deficit with that country. [The White House], [Economic Policy Institute, May 5, 2016]
- Our annual trade deficit in goods with Mexico has risen from close to zero in 1993 to almost $60 billion. Our total trade deficit in goods hit nearly $800 billion last year. China is responsible for nearly half of our entire trade deficit. Almost half of our entire manufacturing trade deficit in goods with the world is the result of trade with China. [United States Census Bureau]
- The U.S. trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost over 2 million jobs in 2015. By far the biggest losses occurred in motor vehicles and parts, which lost nearly 740,000 manufacturing jobs. Imagine how many more jobs would be lost if the Trans-Pacific Partnership was actually approved. [Economic Policy Institute, March 3, 2016]
- The Trans-Pacific Partnership will undermine our economy, and it will undermine our independence:
- The TPP creates a new international commission that makes decisions the American people can't veto, making it easier for our trading competitors to ship cheap subsidized goods into U.S. markets - while allowing foreign countries to continue putting barriers in front of our exports.
- The TPP lowers tariffs on foreign cars, while leaving in place the foreign practices that keep American cars from being sold overseas. The TPP even creates a backdoor for China to supply car parts for automobiles made in Mexico.
- According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, improved protection of America’s intellectual property in China would produce more than 2 million more jobs right here in the United States. [The Commission On The Theft Of American Intellectual Property, May 2013]

TAX PLAN
DONALD J. TRUMP’S VISION
- Reduce taxes across-the-board, especially for working and middle-income Americans who will receive a massive tax reduction.
- Ensure the rich will pay their fair share, but no one will pay so much that it destroys jobs or undermines our ability to compete.
- Eliminate special interest loopholes, make our business tax rate more competitive to keep jobs in America, create new opportunities and revitalize our economy.
- Reduce the cost of childcare by allowing families to fully deduct the average cost of childcare from their taxes, including stay-at-home parents. 
TAX LAW CHANGES
The Trump Plan will revise and update both the individual and corporate tax codes:
Individual Income Tax
Tax rates
The Trump Plan will collapse the current seven tax brackets to three brackets. The rates and breakpoints are as shown below. Low-income Americans will have an effective income tax rate of 0. The tax brackets are similar to those in the House GOP tax blueprint.
Brackets & Rates for Married-Joint filers: Less than $75,000: 12% More than $75,000 but less than $225,000: 25% More than $225,000: 33% *Brackets for single filers are ½ of these amounts
The Trump Plan will retain the existing capital gains rate structure (maximum rate of 20 percent) with tax brackets shown above. Carried interest will be taxed as ordinary income.
The 3.8 percent Obamacare tax on investment income will be repealed, as will the alternative minimum tax.
Deductions
The Trump Plan will increase the standard deduction for joint filers to $30,000, from $12,600, and the standard deduction for single filers will be $15,000. The personal exemptions will be eliminated as will the head-of-household filing status.
In addition, the Trump Plan will cap itemized deductions at $200,000 for Married-Joint filers or $100,000 for Single filers.
Death Tax
The Trump Plan will repeal the death tax, but capital gains held until death and valued over $10 million will be subject to tax to exempt small businesses and family farms. To prevent abuse, contributions of appreciated assets into a private charity established by the decedent or the decedent’s relatives will be disallowed.
Childcare
Americans will be able to take an above-the-line deduction for children under age 13 that will be capped at state average for age of child, and for eldercare for a dependent. The exclusion will not be available to taxpayers with total income over $500,000 Married-Joint /$250,000 Single, and because of the cap on the size of the benefit, working and middle class families will see the largest percentage reduction in their taxable income.
The childcare exclusion would be provided to families who use stay-at-home parents or grandparents as well as those who use paid caregivers, and would be limited to 4 children per taxpayer. The eldercare exclusion would be capped at $5,000 per year. The cap would increase each year at the rate of inflation.
The Trump Plan would offer spending rebates for childcare expenses to certain low-income taxpayers through the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). The rebate would be equal to 7.65 percent of remaining eligible childcare expenses, subject to a cap of half of the payroll taxes paid by the taxpayer (based on the lower-earning parent in a two-earner household).
This rebate would be available to married joint filers earning $62,400 ($31,200 for single taxpayers) or less. Limitations on costs eligible for exclusion and the number of beneficiaries would be the same as for the basic exclusion. The ceiling would increase with inflation each year.
All taxpayers would be able to establish Dependent Care Savings Accounts (DCSAs) for the benefit of specific individuals, including unborn children. Total annual contributions to a DCSA are limited to $2,000 per year from all sources, which include the account owner (parent in the case of a minor or the person establishing elder care account), immediate family members of the account owner, and the employer of the account owner. When established for children, the funds remaining in the account when the child reaches 18 can be used for education expenses, but additional contributions could not be made.
To encourage lower-income families to establish DCSAs for their children, the government will provide a 50 percent match on parental contributions of up to $1,000 per year for these households. When parents fill out their taxes they can check a box to directly deposit any portion of their EITC into their Dependent Care Savings Account. All deposits and earnings thereon will be free from taxation, and unused balances can rollover from year to year.
Business Tax
The Trump Plan will lower the business tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent, and eliminate the corporate alternative minimum tax. This rate is available to all businesses, both small and large, that want to retain the profits within the business.
It will provide a deemed repatriation of corporate profits held offshore at a one-time tax rate of 10 percent.
It eliminates most corporate tax expenditures except for the Research and Development credit.
Firms engaged in manufacturing in the US may elect to expense capital investment and lose the deductibility of corporate interest expense. An election once made can only be revoked within the first 3 years of election; if revoked, returns for prior years would need to be amended to show revised status. After 3 years, election is irrevocable.
The annual cap for the business tax credit for on-site childcare authorized by Sec. 205 of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 would be increased to $500,000 per year (up from $150,000) and recapture period would be reduced to 5 years (down from 10 years).
Businesses that pay a portion of an employee’s childcare expenses can exclude those contributions from income. Employees who are recipients of direct employer subsidies would not be able to exclude those costs from the individual income tax and the costs of direct subsidies to employees could not be used as a cost eligible for the credit.
CONTRAST WITH HILLARY CLINTON
- The Trump Plan protects all low-income and middle-income Americans and lowers their taxes. As the Tax Foundation put it: “Donald Trump’s plan is a tax cut for all income groups, while Hillary Clinton’s plan is a tax increase on selected income groups”. The Tax Foundation determined that, on average, taxpayers will receive a tax cut of $1,818 under the Trump Plan, but a tax increase of $176 under the Clinton plan. [Tax Foundation, Sept. 23, 2016]
- Donald J. Trump’s tax plan will increase the economy and grow jobs by almost 2 million, while Hillary Clinton’s tax plan will shrink the economy and lose 300,000 jobs. In combination with the total economic reform agenda, the Trump economic plan will create at least 25 million jobs over the next 10 years. [Tax Foundation, Sept. 19, 2016], [Tax Foundation, Jan. 26, 2016]. 

REGULATIONS
DONALD J. TRUMP’S VISION
- Ask all Department heads to submit a list of every wasteful and unnecessary regulation which kills jobs, and which does not improve public safety, and eliminate them.
- Reform the entire regulatory code to ensure that we keep jobs and wealth in America. 
- End the radical regulations that force jobs out of our communities and inner cities. We will stop punishing Americans for working and doing business in the United States.
- Issue a temporary moratorium on new agency regulations that are not compelled by Congress or public safety in order to give our American companies the certainty they need to reinvest in our community, get cash off of the sidelines, start hiring again, and expanding businesses. We will no longer regulate our companies and our jobs out of existence.
- Cancel immediately all illegal and overreaching executive orders.
- Eliminate our most intrusive regulations, like the Waters of The U.S. Rule. We will also scrap the EPA’s so-called Clean Power Plan which the government estimates will cost $7.2 billion a year.
- Decrease the size of our already bloated government after a thorough agency review.
KEY ISSUES
- Every year, over-regulation costs our economy $2 trillion dollars a year and reduces household wealth by almost $15,000 dollars. [Donald J. Trump Press Release, Sept. 15, 2016]

- Hillary Clinton Has Vowed To “Defend And Build On” The Obama Administration’s Anti-Coal Regulations. [Donald J. Trump Press Release, August 11, 2016]

NATIONAL DEFENSE
DONALD J. TRUMP’S VISION
- Work with Congress to fully repeal the defense sequester and submit a new budget to rebuild our depleted military.
- Increase the size of the U.S. Army to 540,000 active duty soldiers, which the Army Chief of Staff says he needs to execute current missions.
- Rebuild the U.S. Navy toward a goal of 350 ships, as the bipartisan National Defense Panel has recommended.
- Provide the U.S. Air Force with the 1,200 fighter aircraft they need.
- Grow the U.S. Marine Corps to 36 battalions.
- Invest in a serious missile defense system to meet growing threats by modernizing our Navy's cruisers and procuring additional, modern destroyers to counter the ballistic missile threat from Iran and North Korea.
- Emphasize cyber warfare and require a comprehensive review from the Joint Chiefs of Staff and all relevant federal agencies to identify our cyber vulnerabilities and to protect all vital infrastructure and to create a state-of-the-art cyber defense and offense.
- Pay for this necessary rebuilding of our national defense by conducting a full audit of the Pentagon, eliminating incorrect payments, reducing duplicative bureaucracy, collecting unpaid taxes, and ending unwanted and unauthorized federal programs.

IMMIGRATION
DONALD J. TRUMP’S VISION
- Prioritize the jobs, wages and security of the American people.
- Establish new immigration controls to boost wages and to ensure that open jobs are offered to American workers first.
- Protect the economic well-being of the lawful immigrants already living here by curbing uncontrolled foreign worker admissions
- Select immigrants based on their likelihood of success in the U.S. and their ability to be financially self-sufficient.
- Vet applicants to ensure they support America’s values, institutions and people, and temporarily suspend immigration from regions that export terrorism and where safe vetting cannot presently be ensured.
- Enforce the immigration laws of the United States and restore the Constitutional rule of law upon which America’s prosperity and security depend.
Donald J. Trump’s 10 Point Plan to Put America First
1. Begin working on an impenetrable physical wall on the southern border, on day one. Mexico will pay for the wall.
2. End catch-and-release. Under a Trump administration, anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country.
3. Move criminal aliens out day one, in joint operations with local, state, and federal law enforcement. We will terminate the Obama administration’s deadly, non-enforcement policies that allow thousands of criminal aliens to freely roam our streets.
4. End sanctuary cities.
5. Immediately terminate President Obama’s two illegal executive amnesties. All immigration laws will be enforced - we will triple the number of ICE agents. Anyone who enters the U.S. illegally is subject to deportation. That is what it means to have laws and to have a country.
6. Suspend the issuance of visas to any place where adequate screening cannot occur, until proven and effective vetting mechanisms can be put into place.
7. Ensure that other countries take their people back when we order them deported.
8. Ensure that a biometric entry-exit visa tracking system is fully implemented at all land, air, and sea ports.
9. Turn off the jobs and benefits magnet. Many immigrants come to the U.S. illegally in search of jobs, even though federal law prohibits the employment of illegal immigrants.
10. Reform legal immigration to serve the best interests of America and its workers, keeping immigration levels within historic norms.

- Hillary Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days, and her plan will provide Obamacare, Social Security and Medicare for illegal immigrants – breaking the federal budget. On top of that, she promises uncontrolled low-skilled immigration that continues to reduce jobs and wages for American workers, especially African-American and Hispanic workers.
- Hillary Clinton will give citizenship to illegal immigrants who compete directly against vulnerable American workers for the right to high-paying jobs, safe housing and good schools. [Donald J. Trump Press Release, July 28, 2016]
- Hillary Clinton will protect and expand President Obama’s illegal and unconstitutional DACA and DAPA executive actions that give millions of illegal immigrants social security numbers, work authorization, travel authorization, eligibility for benefits, and tax credits in violation of the United States law.
- Hillary Clinton supports making illegal immigrants eligible for Obamacare, which will force American taxpayers to further subsidize illegal immigration.
- Hillary Clinton supports sanctuary cities, the catch-and-release program at the border, visa overstays, and the release of dangerous criminals from detention.
- Hillary Clinton has no plan to secure the border. The ICE agents call her plan "the most radical immigration proposal in U.S. history."

HEALTH CARE
DONALD TRUMP'S VISION
To view Mr. Trump's position, visit https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/healthcare-reform
- Repeal and replace Obamacare with Health Savings Accounts (HSAs).

- Peace through strength will be at the center of our foreign policy. We will achieve a stable, peaceful world with less conflict and more common ground.
- Advance America’s core national interests, promote regional stability, and produce an easing of tensions in the world. Work with Congress to fully repeal the defense sequester and submit a new budget to rebuild our depleted military.
- Rebuild our military, enhance and improve intelligence and cyber capabilities.
- End the current strategy of nation-building and regime change.
- Ensure our security procedures and refugee policy takes into account the security of the American people.
Read Donald J. Trump’s Plan to Make America Safe and Respected Again, here.

- Defeat the ideology of radical Islamic terrorism just as we won the Cold War.
- Establish new screening procedures and enforce our immigration laws to keep terrorists out of the United States.
- Suspend, on a temporary basis, immigration from some of the most dangerous and volatile regions of the world that have a history of exporting terrorism.
- Establish a Commission on Radical Islam to identify and explain to the American public the core convictions and beliefs of Radical Islam, to identify the warning signs of radicalization, and to expose the networks in our society that support radicalization.

CONTRAST WITH HILLARY CLINTON
- Before the Obama-Clinton Administration took over: Libya was stable, Syria was under control, Egypt was ruled by a secular president and an ally of the United States, Iraq was experiencing a reduction in violence, the group that would become what we now call ISIS was close to being extinguished, and Iran was being choked off by economic sanctions.
- Fast-forward to today: Libya is in ruins, our ambassador and three other brave Americans are dead, ISIS has gained a new base of operations, Syria is in the midst of a disastrous civil war, ISIS controls large portions of territory, a refugee crisis now threatens Europe and the United States, terrorists have gained a foothold in the Sinai desert, Iraq is in chaos, and ISIS is on the loose.

- The Obama-Clinton election-driven timetable for withdrawal from Iraq led directly to the rise of ISIS. [Donald J. Trump Press Release, July 28, 2016]
- Secretary Hillary Clinton’s forceful advocacy for the intervention in Libya to build a Democracy is regarded as President Obama’s worst mistake.

- Hillary Clinton’s State Department admitted five refugees and one translator who were later charged with terrorism and related crimes. [Donald J. Trump Press Release, Aug. 15, 2016]

ENERGY
AN AMERICA FIRST ENERGY PLAN
DONALD J. TRUMP’S VISION
- Make America energy independent, create millions of new jobs, and protect clean air and clean water. We will conserve our natural habitats, reserves and resources. We will unleash an energy revolution that will bring vast new wealth to our country.
- Declare American energy dominance a strategic economic and foreign policy goal of the United States.  
- Unleash America’s $50 trillion in untapped shale, oil, and natural gas reserves, plus hundreds of years in clean coal reserves.
- Become, and stay, totally independent of any need to import energy from the OPEC cartel or any nations hostile to our interests.
- Open onshore and offshore leasing on federal lands, eliminate moratorium on coal leasing, and open shale energy deposits.
- Encourage the use of natural gas and other American energy resources that will both reduce emissions but also reduce the price of energy and increase our economic output. 
- Rescind all job-destroying Obama executive actions. Mr. Trump will reduce and eliminate all barriers to responsible energy production, creating at least a half million jobs a year, $30 billion in higher wages, and cheaper energy.
KEY ISSUES
- Energy costs the average American household $5,000 per year. As a percentage of income, the cost is greater for lower-income families. [Fox News, Sept. 3, 2015]
- Shale energy production could add 2 million jobs in 7 years.
- The oil and natural gas industry supports 10 million high-paying Americans jobs and can create another 400,000 new jobs per year. [The New York Times, June 20, 2015]
CONTRAST WITH HILLARY CLINTON
- Clinton has vowed to “defend and build on” the Obama Administration’s anti-coal regulations, which has earned her support from environmentalists but led to concerns from labor unions. [Donald J. Trump Press Release, Sept. 7, 2016]
- President Obama’s anti-energy orders have weakened our security, keeping us reliant on foreign sources of energy.
- At the same time President Obama lifts economic sanctions on Iran, he imposes economic sanctions on America. His onslaught of regulations has been a massive self-inflicted economic wound and have denied millions of Americans access to the energy wealth sitting under our feet. This is the American People’s treasure, and they are entitled to share in the riches.
- While Hillary Clinton doesn’t want American energy, she is strongly in favor of foreign energy. Here is what she told China as Secretary of State:
- “American experts and Chinese experts will work to develop China’s natural gas resources. Imagine what it would mean for China if China unleashed its own natural gas resources so you are not dependent on foreign oil.” [Donald J. Trump Press Release, July. 31, 2016]
- Hillary Clinton will continue President Obama’s goals of reducing methane emissions by 40-45 percent through standards for both new and existing sources, which will drastically increase the cost of natural gas [Donald J. Trump Press Release, Sept. 7, 2016]
- Hillary Clinton will escalate the war against American energy, and unleash the EPA to control every aspect of our lives:
- She declared that “we’ve got to move away from coal and all the other fossil fuels,” locking away trillions in American wealth.
- In March, Hillary Clinton said: “by the time we get through all of my conditions, I do not think there will be many places in America where fracking will continue to take place.” Keep in mind, shale energy production could add 2 million jobs in 7 years.
- Hillary Clinton says her plan will “put a lot of coal companies and coal miners out of business.” [The Wall Street Journal, Oct. 28, 2015]
- According to the Heritage Foundation, by 2030, the Obama-Clinton energy restrictions will eliminate another half a million manufacturing jobs, reduce economic output by $2.5 trillion dollars, and reduce incomes by $7,000 dollars per person [MilitaryTimes, July 20, 2016]

EDUCATION
ONALD J. TRUMP’S VISION
- Immediately add an additional federal investment of $20 billion towards school choice. This will be done by reprioritizing existing federal dollars.
- Give states the option to allow these funds to follow the student to the public or private school they attend. Distribution of this grant will favor states that have private school choice, magnet schools and charter laws, encouraging them to participate.
- Establish the national goal of providing school choice to every one of the 11 million school aged children living in poverty.
- If the states collectively contribute another $110 billion of their own education budgets toward school choice, on top of the $20 billion in federal dollars, that could provide $12,000 in school choice funds to every K-12 student who today lives in poverty.
- Work with Congress on reforms to ensure universities are making a good faith effort to reduce the cost of college and student debt in exchange for the federal tax breaks and tax dollars.
- Ensure that the opportunity to attend a two or four-year college, or to pursue a trade or a skill set through vocational and technical education, will be easier to access, pay for, and finish.
KEY ISSUES
- At the state and federal level, the United States spends more than $620 billion on K-12 education each year. That’s an average of about $12,296 for every student enrolled in our elementary and secondary public schools.
- We spend more per student than almost any other major country in the world. Yet, our students perform near the bottom of the pack for major large advanced countries.
- Our students continue to lag behind their peers worldwide in knowledge gained. [American Federation for Children Growth Fund]
- Among 34 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development nations, the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) found 27 countries outperformed U.S students in math. [National Center for Education Statistics]
- The same assessment found 17 countries outperformed U.S. students in reading. [National Center for Education Statistics]
- Our largest cities spend some of the largest amounts of money on public schools:
- New York City spends $20,226 per student.
- Baltimore spends $15,287 per student.
- Chicago spends $11,976 per student.
- Los Angeles spends $10,602 per student.
- School choice is vital to reverse inequities in education and failing government schools in Democrat-controlled inner cities. According to the National Assessment of Education Progress, only one in six African-American students in the eighth grade are considered proficient in math and reading. In 2016, over 2 million high school graduates took the ACT:
- 45 percent of all students tested met three or more benchmarks related to college preparedness.
- Only 11 percent of African American students tested met three or more of the benchmarks for college and career readiness. [The Condition of College and Career Readiness, 2016]
- It is time for school choice to help free children from failing government schools and close the achievement gap. School choice is the civil rights issue of our time.
CONTRAST WITH HILLARY CLINTON
- Hillary opposes school choice, furthering education inequities in America and denying low-income African-American and Latino children the future they deserve.
- Hillary Clinton claims Donald Trump’s school choice proposal would “decimate public schools across America.”
- It is no surprise Mrs. Clinton opposes school choice because she is supported by the staunchest opponents of school choice – The American Federation of Teachers super PAC – which donated $1.6 million to the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation and more than $2 million to Hillary’s 2016 presidential campaign. [Wall Street Journal, June 28, 2016]

CONSTITUTION AND SECOND AMENDMENT
DONALD J. TRUMP’S VISION
Constitution
Appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold our laws and our Constitution. The replacement for Justice Scalia will be a person of similar views and principles who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.
- Defend the rule of law and the Constitution of the United States. Nobody is above the law.
- Uphold our freedoms, constitutional values and principles that our country was founded on.
- Protect our Constitutional liberties.
- Protect and defend the bill of rights, including the freedom of religion, speech, press and right to bear arms.
Second Amendment
- Defend the Second Amendment of our Constitution. The right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed upon. Period.
- Nominate United States Supreme Court justices that will abide by the rule of law and the Constitution of the United States that includes upholding the Second Amendment.
- Enforce the laws on the books. We need to get serious about prosecuting violent criminals.
- Expand and bring back programs like Project Exile and get gang members and drug dealers off the street. When we do, crime will go down and our cities and communities will be safer places to live.
- Empower law-abiding gun owners to defend themselves. Law enforcement does a tremendous job, but they can’t be everywhere all of the time. 
- Fix our broken mental health system. All of the tragic mass murders that occurred in the past several years have something in common – there were red flags that were ignored. We can’t allow that to continue. We must expand treatment programs, and reform the laws to make it easier to take preventive action to save innocent lives. Most people with mental health problems are not violent, but just need help, and these reforms will help everyone.
- Defend the rights of law-abiding gun owners:
- Military bases and recruiting centers - to have a strong military, we need to allow them to defend themselves
- National right to carry – should be legal in all 50 states
- Background checks - we need to fix the system we have and make it work as intended. What we don’t need to do is expand a broken system.
- Gun and magazine bans - the government has no business dictating what types of firearms good, honest people are allowed to own
KEY ISSUES
- The next President of the United States could appoint as many as four Supreme Court justices. [CBS News, Jan. 5, 2016]
- Hillary Clinton could remake America by appointing the most extreme far-left Supreme Court threatening our basic rights and freedoms. [Newsweek, May 2016]

- Under the Obama-Hillary Administration, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) admitted to targeting hundreds of conservative organizations. Using the federal government to target and silence political opponents. [Washington Post, May 10, 2013]
- Hillary Clinton has proven that she holds no respect for the rule of law and the Constitution of the United States. She lied to the American people and to the FBI regarding the use of her private email server and sending classified information:
- Hillary Clinton believes that she is above the law by having a private email server set up in the basement of her home while serving as Secretary of State. She sent classified information, even during her travels overseas, jeopardizing the national security of the American people by allowing her emails to be hacked by foreign intelligence services.
- FBI Director James Comey even stated that Secretary Clinton was “extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information”. [FBI Statement on Hillary’s Personal E-mail Server, July 4, 2016]
- Hillary Clinton would give more authority and power to the federal government while stripping state rights. [The Hill, June 25, 2015] 
Second Amendment
- Hillary Clinton will appoint radical Supreme Court justices that will virtually abolish the Second Amendment.
- Hillary Clinton will overturn the Supreme Court ruling that affirmed the Second Amendment as a private right, so that any city or state in this country can ban private gun ownership.
- NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre explained: “If she could, Hillary would ban every gun, destroy every magazine, run an entire national security industry right into the ground” and put gun-owners’ names on a government registration list. [NBC News, May 20, 2016]

- Creating a new, dynamic market for family-based and community-based solutions.
- Incentivizing employers to provide childcare at the workplace.
- Provide 6 weeks of paid leave to new mothers before returning to work.
KEY ISSUES

ECONOMY
DONALD J. TRUMP’S VISION
- Create a dynamic booming economy that will create 25 million new jobs over the next decade.
- For each 1 percent in added GDP growth, the economy adds 1.2 million jobs. Increasing growth by 1.5 percent would result in 18 million jobs (1.5 million times 1.2 million, multiplied by 10 years) above the projected current law job figures of 7 million, producing a total of 25 million new jobs for the American economy.
- Reform policies with a pro-growth tax plan, a new modern regulatory framework, an America-First trade policy, an unleashed American energy plan, and the “penny plan.”
- Boost growth to 3.5 percent per year on average, with the potential to reach a 4 percent growth rate.
KEY ISSUES
- Over the last seven years, 14 million more people have left the labor force.
- The lowest labor force participation rate since the 1970s.
- 1 in 5 American households do not have a single family member in the labor force.
- 23.7 million Americans in their prime-earning years [ages 25-54] are out of the labor force – an increase of 1.8 million over the last seven years.
- Real GDP grew only 1.1% in the second quarter of this year. Over the last seven years, real GDP grew 2.1% the slowest seven-year period since at least the 1940s.
- It’s the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression.
- Hourly earnings and weakly earnings are lower today than they were in 1973.
- The number of Americans on Food Stamps during Obama’s time in office has increased by more than 12 million.
- 2 million more Latinos are in poverty today than when President Obama took his oath of office less than eight years ago.
- 45% of African-American children under 6 are living in poverty.

- Since President Obama took office, the national debt has doubled.
- U.S. trade deficit in goods reached nearly 800 billion dollars last year alone.
- The U.S. homeownership rate fell to 62.9 percent in the second quarter – the lowest rate in 51 years.
CONTRAST WITH HILLARY CLINTON
- Hillary Clinton says she'll put her husband ‘in charge’ of the economy – which is half the job. [ABC News, May 15, 2016]
- Hillary Clinton’s economic plans would send our economy into a tailspin:
- Whereas Trump will cut taxes and reduce anti-growth regulations, she plans massive new tax-and-spend policies, endless regulations and tight government control.
- Her corporatist trade and immigration deals would eviscerate the U.S. middle class.  
- Clinton’s policies are worse than current policies, which have already been evaluated as failures. The Federal Reserve has lowered its estimated growth rate to 1.8% per year through 2019 based on current policies. CBO expects only 2% growth per year for ten years.
