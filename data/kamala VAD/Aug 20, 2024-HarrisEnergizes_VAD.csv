Kamala Harris,"Looking out at everyone tonight, I see the beauty of our great nation. People from every corner of our country and every walk of life are here united by our shared vision for the future of our country and this November we will come together and declare with one voice as one people, we are moving forward. With optimism, hope, and faith so guided by our love of country, knowing we all have so much more in common than what separates us. Let us fight for the ideals we hold dear and let us always remember when we fight, we win. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Good night everyone.",0.7081842105263156,0.4209473684210527,0.5892631578947369
