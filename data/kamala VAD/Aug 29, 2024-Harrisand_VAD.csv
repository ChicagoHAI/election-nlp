Kamala Harris,"You are doing some of the best work any leader can do. And we’re so proud of you. We are counting on you. Your generation, all that you guys stand for, everything you have at stake is what is going to propel our country into the next era of what we can do and we can be. And I want to say to you that you must always lead as you have chosen to lead, understanding you don’t have to ask anybody’s permission to lead. And I think you all have figured that out. You’ve decided to be a leader. And in doing that, you are also role models, right?",0.6690740740740742,0.44385185185185183,0.5891481481481482

It requires a whole lot of rehearsal, a whole lot of practice. Long hours. Sometimes you hit the notes, sometimes you don’t, right? But all that practice makes for beautiful music. And that is a metaphor, that is symbolic for everything that you all will do in your lives, which is you’re going to show what a winning team looks like, you’re going to show what it means to put yourself out on the field, to put yourself in front of people, to have the confidence to do it.",0.6405172413793104,0.46124137931034476,0.5898275862068966
