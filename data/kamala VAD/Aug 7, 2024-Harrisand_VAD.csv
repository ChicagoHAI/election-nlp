Kamala Harris,"Let me just say, it’s good to be here with all of the friends, all of the leaders who are here. I want to thank former Governor Ed Rendell, Senator Bob Casey, who we will re-elect this November, Senator John Fetterman, Mayor Sherrell Parker, and Chairman Jamie Harrison. It is so good to be here with your incredible governor, Josh Shapiro. I’ll say Josh is a dear, dear friend, and an extraordinary leader. He and I have been spending a lot of time together over the years, and I told Josh, look, I am so, so invested in our friendship in doing this together because together with Josh Shapiro, we will win Pennsylvania. We’ll win Pennsylvania. I thank you, Josh. I thank you.",0.7254516129032256,0.44148387096774183,0.645225806451613
Kamala Harris,"Philadelphia, I launched my campaign for the President of the United States a mere two weeks ago, and it’s been a bit of a whirlwind. Just last night, the delegates to the Democratic National Convention finished voting, and so I stand before you today to proudly announce I am now officially the Democratic nominee for President of the United States. Now we got some work to do. We need to move to the general election and win that. To all the friends, listen, we also need to level set. We are the underdogs in this race, but we have the momentum and I know exactly what we are up against.",0.6658928571428573,0.4898928571428571,0.6288571428571429
Kamala Harris,"Now, many of you know, before I was elected vice president or elected a United States Senator, I was an elected attorney general and before that, elected district attorney. Before that, I was a courtroom prosecutor. In those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds. Predators who abused women, fraudsters who scammed consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain, so hear me when I say I know Donald Trump’s type.",0.5310833333333332,0.5391666666666666,0.6354166666666666
Kamala Harris,"Wait, let me just say… Let me say, hold on, hold on, hold on. This campaign, our campaign, is not just a fight against Donald Trump. Our campaign, this campaign, is a fight for the future. It’s a fight for the future. Pennsylvania, we fight for a future with affordable housing, affordable healthcare, affordable childcare, paid leave. We fight for a future where we build a broad-based economy where every American has the opportunity to own a home, to start a business, and to build wealth.",0.6448,0.5569499999999998,0.6303500000000002
Kamala Harris,"We fight for a future where we bring down prices that are still too high and lower the cost of living for America’s families so that they have a chance not just to get by, but to get ahead. We fight for a future where we defend our most fundamental freedoms. The freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence, the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride, and the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body, not having her government tell her what to do. I love you too.",0.7084666666666667,0.5269,0.6661333333333336
Kamala Harris,"Here’s the thing. Since the day that I announced my candidacy, I’ve set out to find a partner who can help build this brighter future. A leader who will help unite our nation and move us forward. A fighter for the middle class, a patriot who believes, as I do, in the extraordinary promise of America. A promise of freedom, opportunity, and justice not just for some, but for all.",0.7231904761904763,0.4965238095238095,0.6713809523809525
Kamala Harris,"Pennsylvania, I’m here today because I found such a leader. Governor Tim Walz of the great state of Minnesota. To those who know him best, Tim is more than a governor. To his wife, Gwen, he is a husband. To his kids, Hope and Gus, he is a dad. To his fellow veterans, he is Sergeant Major Walz. To the people of Southern Minnesota, for 12 years, he was Congressman. To his former high school students, he was Mr. Walz, and to his former high school football players, he was Coach. Coach. Coach. In 91 days, the nation will know Coach Walz by another name, Vice President of the United States. America, for some folks, they’re just getting to know Coach Walz’s story. I’ll tell you, he is the proud product of a middle class family in rural Nebraska. He is a veteran who served our nation in uniform for more than two decades as a member of the Army National Guard, and he went to college on the GI Bill. He is someone who, long before he entered politics, worked as a teacher. When Coach Walz and his wife, Gwen, moved from his native Nebraska to Minnesota nearly 30 years ago, they both took jobs at the local high school coach. Walz taught social studies, Gwen taught English.",0.6734117647058824,0.45392156862745103,0.646764705882353
Kamala Harris,"After school, Tim was the linebacker’s coach for the football team, where I’ve heard the stories about he had a lnack for using the game of football to teach life lessons. He saw the potential in kids who sometimes didn’t even see it in themselves. Under those Friday night lights, Coach Walz motivated his players to believe they could achieve anything and together, they defied the odds… Hear this out, going from a winless record to the school’s first ever state championship.",0.6937368421052631,0.5476842105263158,0.6050526315789473
