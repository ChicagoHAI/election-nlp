Kamala Harris,"Small business owners are the backbone of America’s economy. You are. Through your creativity, tenacity and determination, you help create prosperity and opportunity for millions of people in our country. Our small business owners are business leaders and our small business owners are community leaders and civic leaders. You train young people and hire locally. You support the local softball team. You are role models and mentors. And I’ll tell you, I’ve seen it my whole life.",0.67572,0.4562799999999999,0.57756
Kamala Harris,"Growing up, my mother worked long hours and long days, and weekends from time to time. And when she did, my sister Maya and I would go a couple doors over to Ms. Shelton’s house. So Ms. Shelton ran a nursery school, and we actually lived in the apartment above the nursery school, and Ms. Shelton was our second mother. She was a small business owner and I would not be here today without her. Because you see, Mrs. Shelton was a fixture in our community. She gave support and advice to the young parents in the neighborhood and folks who are going through challenges just as so many of you do.",0.6759545454545455,0.37931818181818183,0.5187727272727274
Kamala Harris,"And as District Attorney of San Francisco, in my career, as Attorney General California and United States Senator, and now as Vice President, I have worked with and met with thousands of small business owners. Folks like you who are here, who fight every day to build a better future for the people you love, for the community you call home, and for our country.",0.6536470588235294,0.495764705882353,0.6297058823529412
Kamala Harris,"You power the ambition and aspirations of our nation and that is why we are fighting every day to make sure you have the resources and the support that you need. For example, we know there are so many small businesses owners who hire employees but want to hire more because your business is growing. Small business owners who want to stock the shelves and make sure you have enough in terms of the supply you need, to do what you need to do in your community. Small business owners who need more capital because you want to design a new product or build a new store,",0.6616315789473685,0.4759736842105263,0.581921052631579
Kamala Harris,"What’s more? Last year we built an historic public-private partnership to help address this issue. We partnered with consumer banks, investment firms, technology companies, and philanthropies to combine the expertise and experience of the private sector with the reach and capacity that can only be provided by the government. As a result, we have secured tens of billions of dollars in private sector investment for small businesses and communities across America. And we are just getting started. So with your support, President Biden and I will continue to fight to make sure every small business owner in our nation and every aspiring small business owner has the opportunity to not only survive, but thrive. And with that, please join me to welcome to the microphone, a leader who exemplifies the excellence of all the small business owners who are here today, Jill Scarborough.",0.7023181818181817,0.4514545454545454,0.6527954545454545
