Kamala Harris,"As we know this, recovery will take time and we will stand with Georgia, and everyone across the southeast who are impacted by these recent storms for as long as it takes to rebuild. Thank you. All right, so Atlanta, we have 17 days left. 17 days left in one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime. And look, let’s have some real talk. It’s going to be a tight race until the very end. And we are the underdog and we are running as the underdog. But make no mistake, we will win. We will win. Yes, we will. We will win. Yes, we will,",0.6551666666666667,0.40041666666666664,0.5686249999999999
Kamala Harris,"But none of that is what we hear from Donald Trump. Instead, it is just the same old, tired playbook over and over again. He has no plan for how he would address the needs of the American people. He is only focused on himself. And now, he’s ducking debates and canceling interviews because of exhaustion. And when he does answer a question or speak at a rally, have you noticed he tends to go off script and ramble, and generally for the life of him, cannot finish a thought. And he has called it the weave, but I think we here will call it nonsense.",0.5819,0.4463500000000001,0.5246
Kamala Harris,"So folks, for these reasons and more, it is time to turn the page. It’s time to turn the page. And America is ready to chart a new way forward. We are ready. We are ready for a new and optimistic generation of leadership. All of you. Which is why Democrats, Republicans, and Independents are supporting our campaign. In fact, earlier this week, over 100 Republican leaders from across the country joined me on the campaign trail, including some who worked in Donald Trump’s administration. And I believe as I travel our country, Americans really want a President who works for all the American people, all the American people, who understands that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us, right? Folks are exhausted with someone trying to have Americans point their fingers at each other. We’re exhausted with it. That’s why I say it’s time to turn the page on that, let’s turn the page, and have a President who cares about all the people.",0.6389250000000001,0.42385,0.5757
Kamala Harris,"And you all know I’ve only ever in my career had one client, the people, the people. As a young courtroom prosecutor, I stood up for women and children. As Attorney general of California, I fought for students and veterans. As Vice President, I have stood up for workers and seniors. And as President, I will fight for all the American people. And together we will build a brighter future for our nation, together we will build a brighter future that includes what I call an opportunity economy. So that every American has the opportunity to own a home, to build wealth, to start a business. And to build that opportunity economy, we’ve got to bring down the cost of living, because while inflation is down and wages are up, prices are still too high. You know it and I know it. And so, I have laid out a comprehensive plan to lower the cost that you pay on everything from prescription medication to groceries. And this will be my focus every single day as President of the United States.",0.65738,0.4982,0.6463599999999999
Kamala Harris,"I will take on corporate price gouging. I’ve done it before and I’ll do it again. I will give a middle class tax cut to a hundred million Americans, including $6,000 during the first year of a child’s life. And I’m going to tell you why. Because we all know, young parents have a natural desire to parent their children well, but not always the resources to do it. And we as a community need to understand they are the children of the community. And it is in our collective best interest to make sure that they have the resources they need during that critical phase of a child’s development, to buy a crib, to buy a car seat, to buy what that child needs during that critical stage of life. That’s the kind of leadership that we believe in in America.",0.6761063829787234,0.46629787234042563,0.5634255319148935
Kamala Harris,"I have a plan to bring down the cost of housing, by building more homes and taking on those corporate landlords who are unfairly buying up properties and increasing rental prices. We know what’s happening. My plan will lower the cost of starting a small business, including by increasing the tax deduction for entrepreneurs from $5,000 to $50,000, knowing that our small business owners are civic leaders as much as they are business leaders. They mentor, they hire locally, they are part of the cultural fabric of our communities and deserve to be lifted up in every way. Under my opportunity economy, I have a plan to lower health costs and healthcare costs for people as they age, so they can grow old with dignity, and so their families are not financially crushed by the cost of home care. Because look, let me tell you, you all may know this, it’s a personal story.",0.6244255319148936,0.4090212765957448,0.5258297872340426
Kamala Harris,"I helped take care of my mother when she was sick. I took care of my mother when she was sick. And for any of you who is taking care of an elder relative, you know that’s about love and it’s about care. It’s about trying to cook something for them that they feel like eating. It’s about trying to help them put on clothes that won’t irritate their skin, help them put on a sweater. It’s about from time to time trying to think of something that will put a smile on their face or make them laugh. It’s about dignity. It’s about dignity. But what we know is that right now we have so many people who are doing that and raising small children at the same time. We call it the sandwich generation. And unless you got a lot of money to be able to hire somebody to help, then folks are looking at the potential of having to leave their job, which is losing a source of income or worse, even having to spend down whatever might be their savings to be able to qualify for Medicaid.",0.6780961538461538,0.42673076923076925,0.5412307692307692
Kamala Harris,"That’s not right. That’s not right. So my plan includes allowing Medicare to cover the cost of home healthcare for our seniors. It’s a matter of dignity. Dignity. And so, I share some of these details with you to just let you know what you are already know. I will always put the middle class and working families first. I always will. I come from the middle class and I will never forget where I come from. I will never forget where I come from. Now, Donald Trump, you know here I go. Now, Donald Trump, well, he has a different plan. Just Google Project 2025. Now, I say it every time, but I just have to say again, can you believe they put that thing in writing? They put it in writing, they published it, they bound it and handed it out. And when you read it, you know it is a detailed",0.5987250000000001,0.3653,0.52785
