Kamala Harris,"And with your help, in November, we will win. We will win. We are not playing around.",0.698,0.408,0.735
Kamala Harris,"So, listen, we know this election is about two very different visions for our nation: one focused on the past, and ours, which is focused on the future. We are fighting for a future where we tap into the ambitions and the aspirations of the American people and build what I call an opportunity economy so every American has an opportunity to own a home, build wealth, start a business.",0.6617500000000001,0.508625,0.6385000000000001
Kamala Harris,"And I’m going to speak about small … Do we have small-business owners in the house right here? Right? Okay. So, on the economy, I’m just going to spend a minute on small businesses. Because let me tell you. So, growing up, our mother often worked very long hours, and so my sister, Maya, and I, we would go over to Ms. Shelton’s house. Ms. Shelton was from Louisiana, and we called her our second mother. And Ms. Shelton was a small-business owner.",0.6125,0.36731249999999993,0.440625
Kamala Harris,"So, from being a child, I know who our small-business owners are. They are community leaders, civic leaders. They mentor. They hire locally. They build up the community. They are part of the fabric of the community. And small-business owners are the backbone of America’s economy.",0.682875,0.373375,0.5778749999999999

Kamala Harris,"You heard Eric talk about it. We need to build more housing in America. You know, my mother saved up for years to buy our first home. I was a teenager by the time she saved up enough to do that. And right now, we know there’s a serious housing shortage in our country, and it is part of what is driving up costs.",0.6742941176470589,0.4359411764705882,0.5692941176470587
Kamala Harris,"So, we will cut the red tape and work with the private sector to build 3 million new homes and provide first-time homebuyers with a $25,000 down payment assistance so you can just literally get your foot in the door, and you’ll handle the rest.",0.6353157894736843,0.4440526315789474,0.5669473684210525
Kamala Harris,"We need to lower the cost of living. Look, our economy is making good progress. Just this morning, we got a solid jobs report, right? Over 250,000 jobs created last month; unemployment fell; and just a few weeks ago, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates, which helps.",0.5335454545454547,0.42736363636363633,0.5200909090909092
Kamala Harris,"But there’s still more we need to do. Prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high. You know it and I know it.

Kamala Harris,"I will give a tax cut to 100 million Americans, including $6,000 extending and expanding the Child Tax Credit, so during the first year of a child’s life young parents have the support they need to be able to buy a car seat, to buy a crib, to take care of their child during that first year of their life, knowing it’s about setting them on a path to do everything they have a natural desire to do.",0.7006333333333334,0.46129999999999993,0.5628
Kamala Harris,"And, look, let me, I say all this to say: I will always put the middle class and working families first. I come from the middle class, and I will never forget where I come from. I will never forget where I come from.",0.5423333333333334,0.3392666666666667,0.4862666666666666
Kamala Harris,"And we know we cannot have a strong middle class without American manufacturing.

We announced the opening of more than 20 new auto plants in the United States. And we did it by investing in American industry and American workers.",0.67425,0.43000000000000005,0.5953125

Kamala Harris,"And, Michigan, let us be clear: Contrary to what my opponent is suggesting, I will never tell you what kind of car you have to drive. But here’s what I will do. I will invest in communities like Flint, which helped build the auto industry and the UAW.",0.6225624999999999,0.44525000000000003,0.597375
Kamala Harris,"We will retool existing factories, hire locally, and work with unions to create good-paying jobs, including jobs that do not require a college degree, because we understand a college degree is not the only measure of whether a worker has skills and experience to get the job done.",0.6961764705882354,0.485764705882353,0.6664705882352941
Kamala Harris,"In fact, part of my plan is to outline all of the federal jobs that should not require a college degree and make that clear. And when I’m elected, I’m going to challenge the private sector to take on the same approach.",0.6199166666666668,0.4503333333333333,0.5986666666666667
Kamala Harris,And then there’s Donald Trump.,,,
Kamala Harris,"So, Donald Trump has a very different approach. So, Donald Trump makes big promises, and he always fails to deliver.",0.6735,0.6034999999999999,0.7702500000000001
Kamala Harris,He said he was the only one who could bring back America’s manufacturing jobs. Remember that?,0.6087999999999999,0.42800000000000005,0.4852
Kamala Harris,"And then America lost nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs when he was president, including tens of thousands of jobs in Michigan. And those losses started before the pandemic, making Donald Trump one of the biggest losers of manufacturing jobs in American history.",0.5645,0.5458333333333333,0.5903333333333335
Kamala Harris,"And his track record for the auto industry was a disaster. He promised workers in Warren that the auto industry would, I’ll quote, “not lose one plant” during his presidency. And then American automakers announced the closure of six auto plants when he was president.",0.48466666666666663,0.4357499999999999,0.49091666666666667

Kamala Harris,"And then he talked down to American workers, saying we can’t compete with Chinese workers.",0.39049999999999996,0.5375,0.525
Kamala Harris,"And make no mistake, Donald Trump is no friend of labor. He encouraged automakers to move their plants out of Michigan so they could pay their workers less.",0.7254999999999999,0.581,0.645
Kamala Harris,"And when the UAW went on strike to demand higher wages that they deserved, Donald Trump went to a nonunion shop, don’t forget, and he attacked the UAW. And he said striking and collective bargaining don’t make, quote, “a damn bit of difference.”",0.4907,0.6186999999999999,0.5954999999999999
Kamala Harris,"Remember how he’s talked about striking workers, that you should fire them. That’s how he talks about union labor. That’s how he talks about workers.",0.59175,0.56975,0.628

Kamala Harris,"And on top of all of that, Donald Trump signed a $2 trillion tax cut that mostly went to the wealthy and big corporations, not to working people.",0.651375,0.53075,0.6565
Kamala Harris,And now he is making the same empty promises to the people in Michigan that he did before. But we will not be fooled. We will not be gaslighted. Donald Trump’s track record is a disaster for working people.,0.535,0.42099999999999993,0.5194
Kamala Harris,"And if he wins again, it will be more of the same. Check this out. Two days ago, his running mate, maybe you saw that. No, but … How about that Tim Walz, by the way? That’s right. That’s right.",0.5761666666666666,0.46649999999999997,0.5425
Kamala Harris,"So, two days ago, Donald Trump’s running mate suggested that if Trump wins, he might let the Grand River assembly plant in Lansing close down, the same plant that our administration helped save earlier this year, along with 650 union jobs.",0.6674,0.41579999999999995,0.5620666666666667

Kamala Harris,"It is a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he will do if he is elected president. Donald Trump will give billionaires and corporations massive tax cuts, attack unions, cut Social Security and Medicare, and impose a Trump sales tax, a 20% tax on everyday basic necessities, which will cost the average family nearly $4,000 a year.",0.5790434782608697,0.48113043478260864,0.6111739130434782

Kamala Harris,"Now, you know, I have said that I do believe he is an unserious man. And the consequences of him being president again are absolutely, critically serious. ‘Cause, think about it. Even on health care, he has a concept of a plan. So, he’s going to threaten the health insurance of 45 million people in our country based on a concept?",0.693076923076923,0.4740769230769231,0.6581538461538462
Kamala Harris,"To take us back, do you remember that, when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions? Remember what that was like?",0.6691428571428572,0.47200000000000003,0.4911428571428572
Kamala Harris,"Well, Michigan, we are not …",,,
Kamala Harris,"And these 32 days out from the election, it’s important that we remind people how we got here. Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would overturn Roe v. Wade, and they did. And now more than one in three women in America lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions even for rape and incest, which is immoral.",0.5451111111111111,0.528,0.593

Kamala Harris,"And here’s what I want to say. Look, and that’s not our only battle. Across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on assault on other hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights, like the freedom to vote; the freedom to be safe from gun violence; the freedom to join a union; the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride; and the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water.",0.7507619047619047,0.4567619047619047,0.6383809523809525
