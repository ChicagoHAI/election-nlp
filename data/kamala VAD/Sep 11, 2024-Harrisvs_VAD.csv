Kamala Harris,"My passion, one of them is small businesses. My mother raised my sister and me, but there was a woman who helped raise us. We call her our second mother. She was a small business owner. I love our small businesses. My plan is to give a $50,000 tax deduction to start up small businesses knowing they are part of the backbone of America’s economy. My opponent on the other hand, his plan is to do what he has done before, which is to provide a tax cut for billionaires and big corporations, which will result in $5 trillion to America’s deficit.",0.62615625,0.42459375,0.5312187500000001
Kamala Harris,"My opponent has a plan that I call the Trump’s sales tax, which would be a 20% tax on everyday goods that you rely on to get through the month. Economists have said that that Trump sales tax would actually result for middle class families in about $4,000 more a year because of his policies and his ideas about what should be the backs of middle class people paying for tax cuts for billionaires.",0.5734347826086956,0.4211739130434783,0.5545217391304348
Kamala Harris,"But I’m going to tell you all in this debate tonight, you’re going to hear from the same old tired playbook, a bunch of lies, grievances, and name-calling. What you’re going to hear tonight is a detailed and dangerous plan called Project 2025 that the former president intends on implementing if he were elected again. I believe very strongly that the American people want a president who understands the importance of bringing us together knowing we have so much more in common than what separates us, and I pledge you to be a president for all Americans.",0.6279166666666667,0.47904166666666664,0.6417083333333333
Kamala Harris,"16 Nobel laureates have described his economic plan as something that would increase inflation and by the middle of next year would invite a recession. You just have to look at where we are and where we stand on the issues, and I’d invite you to know that Donald Trump actually has no plan for you because he is more interested in defending himself than he is in looking out for you.",0.6289473684210526,0.5010526315789474,0.617842105263158
Kamala Harris,"But what Donald Trump did, let’s talk about this with COVID, is he actually thanked President Xi for what he did during COVID. “Thank you, President Xi!” when we know that Xi was responsible for lacking and not giving us transparency about the origins of COVID.",0.6999999999999998,0.46244444444444444,0.6964444444444443
Kamala Harris,"Trump abortion bans that make no exception, even for rape and incest, which understand what that means. A survivor of a crime, a violation to their body does not have the right to make a decision about what happens to their body next. That is immoral. And one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree. The government and Donald Trump certainly should not be telling a woman what to do with her body.",0.5687727272727273,0.512090909090909,0.5981363636363636
Kamala Harris,"I have talked with women around our country. You want to talk about this is what people wanted, pregnant women who want to carry a pregnancy to term suffering from a miscarriage being denied care in an emergency room because the healthcare providers are afraid they might go to jail and she’s bleeding out in a car in the parking lot. She didn’t want that. Her husband didn’t want that. A 12 or 13-year-old survivor of incest being forced to carry a pregnancy to turn? They don’t want that.",0.5227419354838709,0.5962580645161288,0.5155483870967742
Kamala Harris,"And I pledge to you when Congress passes a bill to put back in place the protections of Roe v. Wade as President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. But understand if Donald Trump were to be reelected, he will sign a national abortion ban. Understand in his Project 2025, there would be a national abortion, a monitor that would be monitoring your pregnancies, your miscarriages. I think the American people believe that certain freedoms in particular, the freedom to make decisions about one’s own body should not be made by the government.",0.6281714285714286,0.41960000000000003,0.5992285714285716
Kamala Harris,"The majority of Americans believe in a woman’s right to make decisions about her own body. And that is why in every state where this issue has been on the ballot in red and blue states both, the people of America have voted for freedom.",0.611090909090909,0.4102727272727273,0.5341818181818182
Kamala Harris,"And I’m going to actually do something really unusual and I’m going to invite you to attend one of Donald Trump’s rallies because it’s a really interesting thing to watch. You’ll see during the course of his rallies, he talks about fictional characters like Hannibal Lecter. He will talk about windmills cause cancer. And what you will also notice is that people start leaving his rallies early out of exhaustion and boredom. And I will tell you the one thing you will not hear him talk about is you. You will not hear him talk about your needs, your dreams, and your desires. And I’ll tell you, I believe you deserve a president who actually puts you first. And I pledge to you that I will.",0.6325000000000001,0.41783333333333333,0.5281666666666667
Kamala Harris,"So let’s talk about what is important in this race. It is important that we move forward, that we turn the page on this same old tired rhetoric and address the needs of the American people, address what we need to do about the housing shortage, which I have a plan for, address what we must do to support our small businesses, address bringing down the price of groceries. But frankly, the American people are exhausted with the same old tired playbook.",0.570076923076923,0.4167692307692308,0.4937692307692308
Kamala Harris,"As it relates to my values, let me tell you, I grew up a middle class kid raised by a hardworking mother who worked and saved and was able to buy our first home when I was a teenager. The values I bring to the importance of homeownership, knowing not everybody got handed $400 million on a silver platter and then filed bankruptcy six times, is a value that I bring to my work to say we are going to work with the private sector and home builders to increase 3 million homes, increase by 3 million homes by the end of my first term.",0.6673823529411765,0.45505882352941174,0.5998529411764706
Kamala Harris,My work that is related to having a friend when I was in high school who was sexually assaulted by her stepfather. And my focus then on protecting women and children from violent crime is based on a value that is deeply grounded in the importance of standing up for those who are most vulnerable.,0.6513571428571429,0.5518571428571428,0.6321428571428572
Kamala Harris,My work that is about protecting social security and Medicare is based on long-standing work that I have done protecting seniors from scams. My values have not changed. And what is important is that there is a president who actually brings values and a perspective that is about lifting people up and not beating people down and name-calling. The true measure of the leader is the leader who actually understands that strength is not in beating people down. It’s in lifting people up. I intend to be that president.,0.66316,0.50204,0.6579599999999999
Kamala Harris,"So for everyone watching who remembers what January 6th was, I say, we don’t have to go back. Let’s not go back. We’re not going back. It’s time to turn the page. And if that was a bridge too far for you, well, there is a place in our campaign for you to stand, for country to stand, for our democracy to stand for rule of law and to end the chaos, and to end the approach that is about attacking the foundations of our democracy because you don’t like the outcome. And be clear on that point. Donald Trump, the candidate has said in this election there will be a bloodbath if this and the outcome of this election is not to his liking. Let’s turn the page on this. Let’s not go back. Let’s chart a course for the future and not go backwards to the past.",0.5709428571428573,0.43742857142857144,0.5620571428571428
Kamala Harris,"It must end immediately, and the way it will end is we need a ceasefire deal, and we need the hostages out. And so, we will continue to work around the clock on that, work around the clock also understanding that we must chart a course for a two-state solution. And in that solution, there must be security for the Israeli people and Israel, and in equal measure for the Palestinians. But the one thing I will assure you always, I will always give Israel the ability to defend itself, in particular as it relates to Iran, and any threat that Iran and its proxies pose to Israel, but we must have a two-state solution where we can rebuild Gaza, where the Palestinians have security, self-determination, and the dignity they so rightly deserve.",0.6089047619047618,0.4061666666666667,0.5426666666666667
