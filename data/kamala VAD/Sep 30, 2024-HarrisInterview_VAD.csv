Kamala Harris,"But not everyone has the access to the opportunities that allow them to achieve those things. But we don’t lack for those things, but not everyone gets handed stuff on a silver platter. So my vision for the economy, I call it an opportunity economy, is about making sure that all Americans, wherever they start, wherever they are, have the ability to actually achieve those dreams and those ambitions, which include for middle-class families, just being able to know that their hard work allows them to get ahead.",0.7051000000000001,0.48925,0.65125
Kamala Harris,"I think we can’t, and we shouldn’t aspire to, have an economy that just allows people to get by. People want to do more than just get by. They want to get ahead. I come from the middle class. Look, my mother raised my sister and me. She worked hard. She saved up. By the time I was a teenager, she was able to buy our first home. Home ownership for too many people in our country now is elusive. Gone is the day of everyone thinking they could actually live the American dream.",0.691344827586207,0.436,0.5990689655172413

Kamala Harris,"Some of them have actually assessed that his plan would increase inflation and invite a recession by the middle of next year. So the facts remain that Donald Trump has a history of taking care of very rich people. I’m not mad at anybody for being rich, but they should pay their fair share. But tax cuts for the billionaires in the top corporations in our country and then not really paying much attention to middle-class families.",0.6131428571428571,0.5153809523809524,0.618047619047619

Kamala Harris,"Having American workers in an American company manufacturing that steel for those new industries is going to be critically important not only in terms of our economy, but also in the context of national security. Most people now realize, if we didn’t before the pandemic and the strain on supply chains and an over-reliance on foreign manufacturing, that we have to be intentional about US-based manufacturing and of the products that we have to prioritize. Steel is one of them, and that’s always going to be my priority.",0.6212727272727273,0.46286363636363625,0.6133181818181819

Kamala Harris,"Donald Trump got word of the bill, realized it was going to fix a problem he wanted to run on, and told them to kill the bill, don’t put it up for a vote. He killed a bill that would have actually been a solution because he wants to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. That’s part of what needs to be addressed. My pledge is that when elected president, if the American people will have me, I will bring that bill back, and I will sign it into law.",0.55525,0.484,0.56875
