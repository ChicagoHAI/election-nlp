This page visualizes the log-odds ratio of words between the Republican Party's 2024 and 2016/2020 party platforms. These log-odds scores reflect what words are most statistically overrepresented in the 2024 Platform (largest positive values) vs. the 2016/2020 platform (largest negative values). See [Monroe et al. 2008](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis/article/fightin-words-lexical-feature-selection-and-evaluation-for-identifying-the-content-of-political-conflict/81B3703230D21620B81EB6E2266C7A66) for details about the method and Jack Hessel's [Python implementation here](https://github.com/jmhessel/FightingWords).
