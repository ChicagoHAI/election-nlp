This page visualizes the log-odds ratio of words between Harris and Trump's campaign speeches. These log-odds scores reflect what words are most statistically overrepresented in Trump's speeches (larger positive values) vs. Harris's speeches (largest negative values). See [Monroe et al. 2008](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis/article/fightin-words-lexical-feature-selection-and-evaluation-for-identifying-the-content-of-political-conflict/81B3703230D21620B81EB6E2266C7A66) for details about the method and Jack Hessel's [Python implementation here](https://github.com/jmhessel/FightingWords). Speech transcripts were obtained from [rev.com](https://www.rev.com/blog/transcript-category/2024-election).
